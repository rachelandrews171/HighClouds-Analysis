# HighClouds-Analysis
=The High Cloud Airlines Project is a comprehensive data analytics and business intelligence initiative focused on analyzing key operational and performance metrics for fictional airline.

=The project demonstrates how aviation industry can utilize data-driven decision-making. 

=The goal is to transform raw airline data to meaningful business insights. 

=Using tools like Excel, Power BI, Tableau, and MySQL, the project explores various aspects of airline operations.

=To simulate a real-world data analytics project where multiple tools are used to:

*Clean and prepare data (Excel, MySQL)

*Store and manage large datasets (MySQL)

*Analyze performance metrics (Excel, Power BI)

*Create interactive dashboards and visual reports (Power BI, Tableau)


**Future Scope** - 
This project can evolve into a real-time, predictive intelligence platform for the airline industryâ€”integrating machine learning, passenger segmentation, environmental metrics, and geospatial optimization to help airlines operate smarter, greener, and more customer-centric.
